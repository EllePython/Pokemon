# Pokemon
Over the next few weeks we’ll be building a digital Pokemon (simplified) card game. Complete with features like:

Viewing and searching Pokemon “cards”

Viewing and comparing stats

Adding Pokemon cards to a deck

Opportunities for you to expand functionality like dueling 2 Pokemon against each other.
